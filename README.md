# 🔮 Gibberish Oracle

Welcome to the **Gibberish Oracle** — a minimalist chaos engine that takes gibberish as input and returns randomized, grammatically sensible nonsense. Every letter you type becomes a mysterious word in a sentence that only the cosmos understands.

> ✨ Type. Submit. Receive surreal wisdom. Repeat.
